#Description 
This is the first project in the Udacity Nanodegree program. I use the CRISP DM methodology to analyze the Seattle airbnb dataset for 2016. The CRISP-DM methodology has the following stages:
1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

Using this methodology, I will try to answer the following questions:

1. How is the seasonal occupancy in Seattle? What are the most/least crowded months? 
2. What are the neighbourhood trends in Seattle. Which neighbourhoods have the maximum listings, which are the most/least expensive neighourhoods, how does the availability in different neighbourhoods vary across different seasons. 
3. Can we construct a predictive model to predict the price of a listing based on the different attributes in the datasets. How good is the predictive model? What are some important features that are indicative of the price of the listing? 

The notebook "seattle_airbnb.ipynb" has all the relevant plots and analysis that answer the aforementioned questions.
