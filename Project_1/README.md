# Installation

The notebook requires Python 3 to be installed as well as the following libraries: 
* numpy
* seaborb
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* pandas
The libraries can be installed through anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project

# Datasets
There are three datasets that have been provided: 
* Listings: This dataset has all the airbnb listings in Seattle and the details corresponding to each listing. 
* Reviews: This dataset has all the reviews listed for each listing. 
* Calendar: This dataset has day wise occupancy and price for each listing for the year 2016. 

# Project Description 
This is the first project in the Udacity Nanodegree program. I use the CRISP DM methodology to analyze the Seattle airbnb dataset for 2016. The CRISP-DM methodology has the following stages:
1. Business understanding: 
2. Data understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

Using the CRISM DM methodology, I will try to discuss the following questions:

1. Seasonal trends of price/occupancy in Seattle: What are the most/least crowded months? Which months have the most/least expensive listings? 
2. Neighbourhood trends in Seattle: Which neighbourhoods have the maximum listings? Which neighbourhoods are the most/least expensive? How does the availability in different neighbourhoods vary at different time periods in a year? 
3. Can we construct a predictive model to predict the price of a listing based on the different attributes in the datasets? How good is the predictive model? What are some important features that are indicative of the price of the listing?  

The notebook "seattle_airbnb.ipynb" has all the relevant plots and analysis that answer the aforementioned questions.
